# delimit_monorepo

This repository contains the code for delimit's frontend and contracts

You can visit delimit at https://main.d7ol9brngzzuv.amplifyapp.com

The demo is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rzo_TXwMi4


WARNING: The account that owns the deployed smart contracts was hacked. Thus you shouldn't deposit any funds into the smart contracts or approve the smart contracts to spend your funds. I don't intend to redeploy the contracts with another account as it is expensive and this project is no longer being maintained.
